Write a python code that sum up(index) the position of elements in a given list if the element is negative.
    note: Do not we any built-in fuctions.

You are given a list that involves lists. The innor lists involves 10Ã¼zeri9 numbers writa a code that count # of list that involves at least 1 negative number.

Q1: e.g. : [2,5.-1,4,-3,8]
'''

list = [2,5,-1,4,-3,8]
index = 0
sum = 0
for a in list:
    if a < 0:
        sum += index
        index += 1
    

list = [[1,-2],[2,3]]
count = 0 
for a in list:
    for b in a:
        if b < 0 :
            count += 1
            break

# Write a Python code that multiplies all the positive numbers in a given list. Note: don't use any built-in fucttions.

def multiply_positive(numbers):
    result = 1
    for num in numbers:
        if num > 0:
            result *= num
    return result

# Example usage
numbers = [2, -3, 4, 1, -5]
print(multiply_positive(numbers))  # Output: 8

#Write a Python program that counts how many even numbers are present in a given list. Note: don't use any built-in fucttions.

    count = 0
    for num in numbers:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]
